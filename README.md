# Recognizing-Shapes-in-Images-with-OpenCV
This is a project that focuses on utilizing the OpenCV library for shape detection and recognition in images. OpenCV provides a wide range of functions and algorithms for computer vision tasks, including shape analysis. This project demonstrates how to apply edge detection techniques, such as the Canny edge detector, to identify the edges of shapes within an image. By using contour detection, the project shows how to extract individual shapes based on their boundaries. It then demonstrates how to classify and recognize different shapes, such as triangles, rectangles, and circles, using geometric properties and pattern matching. This project serves as a practical guide for beginners interested in shape recognition using OpenCV, providing them with the knowledge and tools to analyze and identify shapes in images for various applications, including object detection, robotics, and image processing.
